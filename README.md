# 2020-STEM-Away
Machine Learning internship in Summer 2020. Worked with Recommendation and Classification systems using Natural Language Processing. See certificate at https://www.stemaway.com/pub/certificate-5715

## Weeks 1-2: July 20th – July 31st

**Things Learned**

_Technical:_

  **Python (Basic)** – For Loops, Lists, Conditionals

  **Data Mining (Basic)** – Beautiful Soup and Selenium

  **Pandas Dataframe**

_Tools:_

  **Code Management:** Git, Github

  **Project Management:** Slack, Asana

  **Code Editing:** Anaconda, Python, Visual Studio Code

_Soft Skills:_

  Learning Mindset, Online Collaboration, Problem Solving & Troubleshooting
  
**Achievement Highlights**

  Worked with a team in scraping and combining data from a website. Used Beautiful Soup and Selenium for web scraping
  
**Meetings Attended**

  2-3 Weekly ML Team 6 meetings & 2 Weekly Codecademy Group meetings

**Goals for Upcoming Meetings**
  Make observations and begin data pre-processing. Learn basic machine learning models for recommender systems

**Tasks Done**

  **Plan Data Collection:** Collaborated with a small group to record observations about the Codecademy forum. Made a report including the metrics, navigation, display, topic elements, and useful categories of the forum.

  **Data Collection:** Scraped a portion of the categories from the Codecademy forum and put together each topic’s title, category, tags, content, and comments into a csv file. Collaborated with the team in scraping the right elements and optimizing code.
  
## Weeks 3-4: August 3rd – August 14th

**Things Learned**

_Technical:_

  **Data Pre-Processing (Basic)** – Tokenize, Rake, Lemmatizer

  **Machine Learning Models** – TF-IDF score, Vectors, Cosine Similarity

_Tools:_

Jupyter Notebook, Microsoft Excel

_Soft Skills:_

  Learning Mindset, Problem Solving & Troubleshooting, Resourcefulness
  
**Achievement Highlights**

  Performed data cleaning, Began working with Machine Learning models
  
**Meetings Attended**

  2 Weekly ML Team 6 meetings
  
**Goals for Upcoming Meetings**

  Collaborate with team to create a successful machine learning recommendation model

**Tasks Done**

  **Data Pre-Processing:** Utilized tokenization, stopword removal, stemming / lemmatization, and removal of unwanted characters to clean data. Formatted data into a “bag of words” style format.

  **Learned Machine Learning Models:** Researched, took notes on, and began experimenting with TF-IDF, Simple Transformers, and BERT models for a recommendation system.
 
## Weeks 5-6: August 17th – August 28th

**Things Learned**

_Technical:_

**Machine Learning Models** – BERT, Sentence Transformers, TF-IDF

_Tools:_

  Google Colab

  Public Speaking / Presenting, Professionalism
  
**Achievement Highlights**

  Implemented recommender system, Completed final presentation

**Meetings Attended**

  2 Weekly ML Team 6 meetings
  
**Tasks Done**

**Implemented Recommender System:** Created a machine learning recommendation model using Sentence Bert to perform Semantic Search, returning topics similar to any given query.

**Completed Final Presentation:** Worked on, practiced, and presented an overview of the project for the team’s leads and STEM-Away’s mentors. Included phases such as Team Setup, Data Collection, Data Pre-Processing, and Data Modeling.
